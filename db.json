Of those polled, 31% said large numbers of immigrants entering illegally is an \"important\" threat while 14% said it was not important.

The monthly record for encounters was set in December when there were more than 300,000 encounters for the first time.

(Christian Torres/Anadolu via Getty Images)     In the poll , 28% of Americans say immigration is the most important problem facing the U.S., sharply higher than in January when the number was 20%. The polling highlights immigration as the most-named problem, above government (20%), the economy (12%) and inflation (11%). That 28% essentially ties the 27% recorded in July 2019 as the highest since Gallup began polling mentions of immigration in 1981.     \n        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {\n          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {\n            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3');\n          });\n        } else {\n          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');\n        }\n       The poll was conducted between Feb. 1 and Feb. 20, based on a sample of 1,016 adults via telephone interviews. It comes as immigration remains in the spotlight due to a debate in Congress over a  supplemental border funding bill , which stalled amid opposition from Republicans and some Democrats, and the continued impact the migrant crisis is having on cities and states across the country. Republicans have blamed the crisis on the policies of the administration, including the rollback of Trump-era policies like border wall construction and the Remain in Mexico policy. The administration and Democrats have instead blamed Republicans for failing to approve funding and a comprehensive immigration reform bill to fix a broken system.     7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES   Video         \n        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {\n          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {\n            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4');\n          });\n        } else {\n          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');\n        }\n       The Senate bill would have increased personnel at the border, provided additional funding and imposed some limits on migrant releases into the U.S., but conservatives warned that it would normalize an already high level of illegal immigration.

(Christian Torres/Anadolu via Getty Images)     In the poll , 28% of Americans say immigration is the most important problem facing the U.S., sharply higher than in January when the number was 20%. The polling highlights immigration as the most-named problem, above government (20%), the economy (12%) and inflation (11%).

It comes as immigration remains in the spotlight due to a debate in Congress over a  supplemental border funding bill , which stalled amid opposition from Republicans and some Democrats, and the continued impact the migrant crisis is having on cities and states across the country. Republicans have blamed the crisis on the policies of the administration, including the rollback of Trump-era policies like border wall construction and the Remain in Mexico policy. The administration and Democrats have instead blamed Republicans for failing to approve funding and a comprehensive immigration reform bill to fix a broken system.     7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES   Video         \n        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {\n          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {\n            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4');\n          });\n        } else {\n          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');\n        }\n       The Senate bill would have increased personnel at the border, provided additional funding and imposed some limits on migrant releases into the U.S., but conservatives warned that it would normalize an already high level of illegal immigration.
